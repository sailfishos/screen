- Change screen's behavior to do the following: Attempt to use
  ~/.screen as the screen directory.  Failing that (ie, on files
  systems without Unix sockets support), try using /tmp/screen-<USER>.
  This prevents a user from creating /tmp/screens (which inherits
  the sticky bit from /tmp, preventing other users from using screen),
  as well as *tries* to be more secure.

- Rebuilt

  the screen terminal type.
